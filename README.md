# Income-Tax-and-National-Insurance-Calculator
Personal Income Tax and National Insurance Calculator

This calculator works out how much you will pay in income tax and ni contributions for employes on payee within the uk.

Simply enter the hourly wage, and weekly hours worked. e.g. Â£11.20 per hour, 37.50 hours worked per week. Then press submit.

It will provide the following breakdown:
- Your annual gross salary (before deductions)
- Your monthly gross salary (before deductions)
- How much is considered taxable income
- How much you'd need to pay per year and month in tax
- How much you'd need to contribute towards ni per week and month
- Your monthly net pay (take home pay after deductions)

This is only for the year 2021 - 2022. Tax rates are changing all the time so this may, or may not work in the future.

Tax rates for the uk will be changing from April 2022 so unless I update it by then, it will no longer be accurate.

I do intent on building on this project in the future. namely, I want to add in a pension contribution function to it.

I also would like to add an additional calculator to this app, specifically for self employed individuals.
